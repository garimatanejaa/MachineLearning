#Machine learning 
####Hi,in this repository I will be adding what all I have learnt in machine learning 
##Types of Machine Learning
1. Supervised learning 
2. Unsupervised learning

###Supervised Learning
- In this, the machine has to be first trained on the dataset we want to work with and then later tested.
  - Logistic Regression
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree
###Unsupervised Learning
- In this, the machine can make its own paarent and test the dataset in the way it wants to.

#####Linear Regression
